VOLCANO ERUPTION

HOW TO TRIGGER THE EVENT:
Click anywhere on the world map with the mouse.
A volcano will spawn at the clicked location and immediately erupt.


WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE EVENT IS TRIGGERED:
1. VISUAL CHANGES (Background):
   - A circular(ish) area with a radius of 4 tiles around the volcano turns into burnt dirt
   - The affected tiles change to show volcanic/burnt ground imagery
   - This also is the area where entities are affected by the eruption (some entities on the outskirts still get effected)

2. ENTITY CHANGES (Affected Entities):
   - All entities within a 5-tile radius transform to Burnt versions  
   - Dudes -> BurntDude (The new action is fleeing from Lava Monsters)
   - Trees -> BurntTree (burning, but stay static)
   - Saplings -> BurntSapling (become burnt and stay static)
   - Fairies -> BurntFairy (The new action is fleeing from Lava Monsters)
   - Houses -> BurntHouse (Burnt but stay static)
   - Stumps -> BurntStump (start burning and stay static)
   - These transformed all entities change appearance - fairy and Dudes change movement behavior

3. NEW ENTITY:
   - 2-4 LavaMonster entities spawn around the volcano after eruption

WHAT THE BURNT ENTITIES DO:
BurntDude: 
- APPEARANCE: Burnt(Red) appearance 
- BEHAVIOR CHANGES:
  - They no longer gather resources 
  - They actively run away from LavaMonsters and Volcanoes
  - They move faster than normal dudes
  - When no threats are nearby, they wander randomly in panic
  - This essentially means they now prioritize their survival over anything else 

BurntFairy:
- APPEARANCE: Burnt(Red) fairy 
- BEHAVIOR: Similar to burnt dudes - flees from volcano and lava monsters
- Likewise prioritizes its own survival and forgets about saplings

WHAT THE NEW ENTITY DOES AND HOW IT BEHAVES:
- APPEARANCE: Animated lava creature
- BEHAVIOR:
  - Seeks out and hunts Trees and Stumps
  - Moves toward the nearest Tree or Stump
  - When it reaches a target, it destroys it and burns the ground beneath
  - Converts the background tile to burnt (Like what happens when a volcano erupts)
  - This eventually causes all the trees and stumps to be gone
